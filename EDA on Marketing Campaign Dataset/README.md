## EDA on Marketing Campaign Dataset   


### Problem Statement:

An online retail company which sells food, beverage, and other accessories has recently ran some Digital Marketing Campaigns. Now, it wants to know the performance of its campaigns and the hidden trends and patterns of customer behaviour. I have been tasked to perform EDA and come up with useful insights.   

### Project Description:

In this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given marketing camapign dataset using Python programming language. The objective is to analyse the dataset and draw useful insights about the marketing campaigns.

Python Libraries used:  

a) Pandas and Numpy for data analysis and manipulation  
b) Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  


### What I have learned by doing this project:   

1)	reading data from CSV files and loading it into a Pandas dataframe     
2)	5-number statistical summary using describe()  
3)	data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas:   
  a)	removing white spaces and unnecessary characters  
  b)	converting the datatypes of certain columns to appropriate datatypes  
  c)	handling missing values and imputing them with the median to avoid the effect of outliers  
  d)	detecting outliers using box-plot and percentile methods and removing them  
4)	Feature Engineering â€“ to create new features from the existing features for better data analysis  
5)	Histogram and Probability Density Function (PDF), distribution of the data points  
6)	Skewness of the data   
7)	1D and 2D scatter plots, Line plot  
8)	Correlation between different variables  
9)	some important Statistics and Digital Marketing concepts   
10)	some solutions to important questions like best selling products and category, sales amount from different countries, most successful marketing campaign, etc.
