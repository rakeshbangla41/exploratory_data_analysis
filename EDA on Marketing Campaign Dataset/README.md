## EDA on Marketing Campaign Dataset   


### Problem Statement:

An online retail company which sells food, beverage, and other accessories has recently ran some Marketing Campaigns. Now, it wants to know the performance of its campaigns and the hidden trends and patterns of customer behaviour.    

As a Data Analyst, I have been given the task to perform EDA and come up with useful insights which would assist the company in its decision-making.   


### Project Description:  

In this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given marketing camapign dataset using Python programming language. I have used the following Python libraries: 

a)	Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and manipulation  
b)	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  

The objective is to analyse the dataset and draw meaningful insights about the marketing campaigns. This analysis will help the company to understand its customer demographics and purchase behaviour, revenue from each category, the correlation between features, and the acceptance rate of marketing campaigns.   

These insights would help the marketing team to design an effective marketing strategy to maximize the profit for the next campaign.    
  
I have uploaded both the iPython notebook (.ipynb file) and the PDF version of the project.

### What I have learned by doing this project:   

1)	learned how to use various Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization  
2)	how to clean, transform and manipulate data using Pandas. Few of them are:      
    a)	removing white spaces and unnecessary characters    
    b)	converting the datatypes of certain columns to appropriate datatypes    
    c)	handling missing values and imputing them with the median to avoid the effect of outliers    
    d)	detecting outliers using box-plot and percentile methods and removing them   
3)	Feature Engineering – how to create new features from the existing features for better data analysis  
4)	important statistical concepts and techniques:  
    a)	5-number statistical summary (minimum, 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile, maximum) and also the mean and standard deviation  
    b)	univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
    c)	how to detect and treat missing values and outliers in a dataset  
    d)	data distribution and skewness of the data  - right-skewed distribution and left-skewed distribution  
    e)	correlation between different variables    
5)	data visualization techniques – histogram and Probability Density Function (PDF), 1D and 2D scatter plots, line plot, box-plot, correlation heatmap
